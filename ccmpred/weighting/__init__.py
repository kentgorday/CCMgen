def get_HHsuite_neff(msa):
    """
    Adapted from the HHsuite manual:

    The number of effective sequences is exp of the average sequence entropy over all columns of the alignment.
    Hence, Neff is bounded by 0 from below and 20 from above.
    In practice, it is bounded by the entropy of a column with background amino acid distribution f_a:
    Neff < sum_a=1^20 f_a log f_a approx 16

    Parameters
    ----------
    msa

    Returns
